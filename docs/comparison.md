| **Lines of Code** | ~180 | Simple and readable |

**Strengths:**
- ⚡ Lightning-fast build times
- 📦 Tiny binary size
- 🎯 Simple, intuitive API

**Trade-offs:**
- Basic rendering quality (good but not premium)
- Simpler effects compared to Skia
- Less control over advanced graphics features

### Skia

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Binary Size** | TBD | Expected ~1-2 MB (statically linked) |
| **Expected FPS** | 60 fps | Hardware accelerated |
| **Build Time** | 10-30 mins | Full Skia build from source |
| **Dependencies** | Complex | Full Chromium depot_tools |
| **Lines of Code** | ~240 | More verbose but powerful |

**Strengths:**
- 🎨 Production-grade rendering quality
- ✨ Advanced antialiasing and effects
- 🌐 Used by Chrome, Android, Flutter
- 💪 Battle-tested at scale

**Trade-offs:**
- Large binary size
- Complex build system
- Longer compile times
- Steeper learning curve

- Installed via Homebrew in seconds
- Code compiles immediately
- API is self-explanatory
- Great for rapid prototyping
- Extensive examples available

**Cons:**
- Limited advanced features
- Simpler rendering pipeline

### Skia: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

## Code Comparison

### Drawing a Circle

**Raylib:**
```c
DrawCircle(x, y, radius, color);
```

**Skia:**
```cpp
SkPaint paint;
paint.setColor(SK_ColorBLACK);
paint.setAntiAlias(true);
canvas->drawCircle(x, y, radius, paint);
```

### Drawing a Bezier Curve

**Raylib:**
```c
// Manually draw segments
for (int i = 0; i < segments; i++) {
    float t1 = (float)i / segments;
    float t2 = (float)(i + 1) / segments;
    float x1 = (1-t1)*(1-t1)*start.x + 2*(1-t1)*t1*control.x + t1*t1*end.x;
    // ... calculate y1, x2, y2
    DrawLineEx((Vector2){x1, y1}, (Vector2){x2, y2}, 8.0f, BLACK);
}
```

**Skia:**
```cpp
SkPath path;
path.moveTo(start);
path.quadTo(control, end);

SkPaint paint;
paint.setStyle(SkPaint::kStroke_Style);
paint.setStrokeWidth(8);
canvas->drawPath(path, paint);
```

**Winner:** Skia for complex paths, Raylib for simple shapes

## WebAssembly Performance

### Expected Results

**Raylib WASM:**
- Bundle size: ~300-500 KB
- Load time: <1 second
- FPS: 60 (good browser support)
- Compatibility: Excellent

**Skia CanvasKit WASM:**
- Bundle size: ~1.8 MB compressed
- Load time: 1-3 seconds
- FPS: 60 (highly optimized)
- Compatibility: Excellent

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose Raylib If:

✅ **Rapid prototyping** - Get something working in minutes
✅ **Simple 2D graphics** - Shapes, sprites, basic effects
✅ **Small binary size** - Embedded systems, size-constrained environments
✅ **Learning graphics programming** - Gentle learning curve
✅ **Game development** - Built-in physics, audio, collision detection

### Choose Skia If:

✅ **Production apps** - Commercial products with premium UI
✅ **Advanced rendering** - Gradients, filters, complex paths
✅ **Cross-platform consistency** - Same rendering across platforms
✅ **Web + native** - Leverage CanvasKit for browser deployment
✅ **Flutter/Chrome ecosystem** - Already using these tools

---

## Robotics Context (Your Use Case)

For a **robot face interface on Jetson Nano + web dashboard**:

### Recommendation: **Start with Raylib, migrate to Skia if needed**

**Phase 1 (Raylib):**
1. ✅ Prove the concept quickly
2. ✅ Test on Jetson Nano hardware
3. ✅ Iterate on animation timings
4. ✅ Get user feedback

**Phase 2 (Optional Skia):**
- If visual quality becomes critical
- If you need advanced effects (blur, shadows, gradients)
- If you want to match Chrome/Android quality standards

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Use **Raylib** for robot-side rendering (Jetson Nano)
- Use **Skia CanvasKit** for web dashboard (browsers)
- Different libraries, same visual output

## Conclusion

Both libraries are excellent choices, but for different reasons:

**Raylib is perfect for:**
- Getting started quickly
- Prototyping robot interfaces
- Embedded systems (Jetson Nano)
- When simplicity matters more than pixel-perfect rendering

**Skia is perfect for:**
- When visual quality is paramount
- Large-scale production applications
- When you need the same engine as Chrome/Android/Flutter
- Complex graphics with advanced effects

**For your robot face project on M3 Pro + Jetson Nano:**
Start with Raylib. It's already working, compiles in 2 seconds, and produces a 34KB binary. You can always add Skia later for the web dashboard if you need premium rendering quality.
